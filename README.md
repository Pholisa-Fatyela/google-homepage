Project for google homepage and/or results page. From The Odin Project's curriculum (http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)

What have I learned following completion?:

I did not take in and solidify nearly enough from the curriculum in the lead up to this task.
Whilst I could get elements on the page and style them to a degree I was unable to position them without going into the dev tools for reference.
That the difference with tight code and poor code can be a huge number of lines (from comparing mine to more successful submissions).
The process of problem solving in trying to get the site you want is most satisfying.
It would be beneficial to go look at some grid/flexbox/positioning resources as a next step.
The best way for me to learn (a ratio of time to solidifying knowledge) is going to be to build and build and build.
